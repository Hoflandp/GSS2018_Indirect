# GSS2018_Indirect

This is the repository for Group 3, covering the topic of *Dark Matter Indirect Detection*. See the main repository - [GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018](https://github.com/bradkav/GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018) - for more information.

In particular, for information about the scripts, [see here](https://github.com/bradkav/GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018/wiki/Scripts).

Use the `review/` folder for the LaTeX files for your review and the `scripts/` folder for your code.

### Comments

* Observing gamma rays doesn't tell us about the distribution of Dark Matter (yet!). Rather, we use kinematic data to tell us about the distribution of Dark Matter, which tells us where to look for Dark Matter.
* How do we estimate the amount of Dark Matter in (e.g.) dwarfs?
* 'Striking' evidence of cores in dwarf galaxies: arXiv:0810.2119
