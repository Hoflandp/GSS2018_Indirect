# GSS2018_Indirect

This is the repository for Group 3, covering the topic of *Dark Matter Indirect Detection*. See the main repository - [GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018](https://github.com/bradkav/GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018) - for more information.

In particular, for information about the scripts, [see here](https://github.com/bradkav/GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018/wiki/Scripts).

Use the `review/` folder for the LaTeX files for your review and the `scripts/` folder for your code.

### Comments

* Observing gamma rays doesn't tell us about the distribution of Dark Matter (yet!). Rather, we use kinematic data to tell us about the distribution of Dark Matter, which tells us where to look for Dark Matter.
* How do we estimate the amount of Dark Matter in (e.g.) dwarfs?
* 'Striking' evidence of cores in dwarf galaxies: arXiv:0810.2119
* How do we decide where to look for (e.g.) gamma rays from Dark Matter? The interplay between signal and background.

### Comments on the scripts

The Dark Matter density profile plots are very nice, as well as the J-factor plots. Here are a few extra suggestions:

* It would be great to have a little text/latex in the notebook. You can add markdown cells to the notebook and put in some brief explanations. For example, this could include some definitions of the density profiles or definition of the J-factor.
* It would be nice also to calculate the equivalent of the J-factor for the *decay* of Dark Matter rather than annihilation. In this case, you just integrate over the density rather than the density-squared. How do the Milky Way and Dwarfs compare in that case?
