## Scripts

This is where your scripts will go. These should predominantly be in the form of `jupyter` notebooks, but beyond that, feel free to use whatever directory structure you feel is sensible.

You can also use this README file for notes, lists and explanations of the scripts.


GRAPPA_student2.ipynb is the script


data.txt contains the data for the dwarf galaxies


clusters.txt contains the data for the galaxy clusters
